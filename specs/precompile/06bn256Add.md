# bn256Add precompile

## Procedure

The `bn256Add` precompile add given two points and return result point over alt_bn128 curve. Fistly, the input is divided into four parts to get two points $x$ and $y$. Secondly, the alt_bn128 points are initialized with given pairs of $x$ and $y$. Finally, the result point is converted to byte and returned.

### Circuit behavior

Two points are recovered from input. The field is expressed as `32` bytes for each and the input includes two points so the input size is `128` bytes.

```
input[0; 31] (32 bytes): x1
input[32; 63] (32 bytes): y1
input[64; 95] (32 bytes): x2
input[96; 128] (32 bytes): y2
```

These two points are added and the result is returned. The result size is `64` bytes and $x$ and $y$ are montgomery form.

```
input[0; 31] (32 bytes): x
input[32; 63] (32 bytes): y
```

1. Do a busmapping lookup for CallContext CalleeAddress.
2. Do a busmapping lookup for CallContext CallerId.
3. Do a busmapping lookup for CallContext CallDataOffset.
4. Do a busmapping lookup for CallContext ReturnDataOffset.
5. Do a CopyTable lookup to verify the copy from calldata to precompile call context memory.

### Gas cost

The gas cost of `bn256Add` precompile is constant.

1. A constant gas cost `150 gas`

## Constraints

1. prId == 0x06
2. state transition:
   - rw_counter + 5 + 2 * `copy_length`
   - gas + 150
